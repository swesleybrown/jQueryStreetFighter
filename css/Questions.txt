why doesn't margin shorthand work but margin-top: does
  see .streetFighterLogo in main.css

there is a bug where when you press the x button and you press the mouse button both actions take place causing both images to appear
  - to fix this i am going to try and cancel one action when another is taking place
      - cancel x when mouse is depressed
      - tried to do cool().hide when mouse was depressed and it didn't work
      - tried to do cool().finish when mouse was depressed and it didn't work
  - when pressing on the mouse button a second time before the hadouken finishes a function     causes the hadouken to finish and hide
      - i will try to do the same thing with the cool pose i will try and finish it and hide         it.
            $('.ryu-throwing').show(
              function() {
                $('.ryu-cool').finish();
                $('.ryu-cool').hide();
              }
            );
        - did not work
      - instead of finish and hide i will try .stop()
          $('.ryu-throwing').show(
            function() {
              $('.ryu-cool').stop();
            }
          );
        - didn't work
        - $('.ryu-cool').stop(); tried to mouse down didn't work either
